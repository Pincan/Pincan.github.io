<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

I am currently pursuing my Ph.D. in Information Technology at Carleton University, co-supervised by Prof. Fei Richard Yu and Prof. Richard Dansereau.

I am also pursuing my second Ph.D. in Information and Communication Engineering at Xidian University, supervised by Prof. Changle Li.

Before (Sep. 2015 - Jun. 2019), I completed my Bachelor degree in Communication Engineering at China University of Petroleum.

My research interests span the intersection of intelligent transportation systems, artificial intelligence, and security, focusing on developing innovative solutions for next-generation transportation. Current research directions emphasize efficient and secure cooperative sensing frameworks for connected and autonomous vehicles (CAVs), leveraging advanced machine learning techniques and privacy-preserving mechanisms.
